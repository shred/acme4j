acme4j Example
==============

An example tool that uses _acme4j_, and a good starting point to find out how _acme4j_ is used.

This tool registers a new account with the _Let's Encrypt_ staging server, and fetches a certificate for a set of domains.

How to Use
----------

Run the `org.shredzone.acme4j.ClientTest` class with the domains to be registered as parameters.

You can also invoke the example tool via maven:

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="example.com example.org"
```

Or just have a look at [the source code](./apidocs/src-html/org/shredzone/acme4j/ClientTest.html).
